## Introduction

Malaria is a serious and often fatal disease that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium, which is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is a significant public health concern, with an estimated 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths reported globally in 2019. The disease is particularly devastating in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is a leading cause of death among children under five. Malaria is preventable and treatable, but efforts to control and eliminate the disease continue to face challenges such as drug resistance and mosquito control. In this context, raising awareness and understanding about malaria is crucial in the fight against this global health threat.

The aim of our project is to use AI techniques in analysis on country and continent that has the most cases in the time period of 2010 to 2017. 
This will help to identify the high risk spots and low risk spots, to be beter prepared medically. Other than that, people can be avare of the risk
and be more cautious when they are in high risk spot. If there is a new outburst of malaria all over the world, we can use this analysis to identify 
the high risk nations and low risk nations to distribute the medical assitant acording to the risk.

## How To Deploy Model
1. Prepare Environment – For our model, we use Google Collab as IDE.

3. Data Preparation
  
  A) Drop Unwanted coloumn
  

## Used Dataset
The dataset we used is from Kaggle entitled Malaria Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/malaria-dataset). The dataset is consist of 107 countries in total and is from year 2010 until 2017. 

## Tools
Google collab as our IDE in running model

## Programming Language
Python

Why python?

Python is a well-liked programming language for statistical and data analysis because of its ease of use, adaptability, and abundance of libraries and tools. Python is a great option for both beginners and experts because of its simple, unambiguous syntax that is simple to learn and interpret. Additionally, Python provides a large selection of libraries and frameworks like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn that are especially made for scientific computing and data analysis. Python is a great choice for creating models and analysing data in malaria research because of these libraries' extensive tools for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Furthermore, Python has a sizable and vibrant community that offers developers and researchers a wealth of tools and help, making it simpler to resolve challenging issues.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this malaria data analysis project aimed to contribute to the fight against malaria by analyzing data to identify trends and patterns in malaria. The project used a range of analytical tools and techniques, such as data visualization, regression analysis, and machine learning, to extract insights from the data.

The results of this project can contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat malaria by providing insights into the epidemiology of the disease and the effectiveness of various interventions. These insights can inform the development and implementation of targeted malaria control and elimination programs. 

While there is still much work to be done in the fight against malaria, the results of this project demonstrate the power of data analysis in addressing complex public health challenges. Continued research and analysis of malaria data is critical for improving our understanding of the disease and developing effective prevention and control strategies. The insights gained from this project can contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat malaria and bring us one step closer to a world without this deadly disease.
