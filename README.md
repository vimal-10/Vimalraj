# World Malaria Analysis from 2010 to 2017

## Introduction

The aim of our project is to use AI techniques in analysis on country and continent that has the most cases in the time period of 2010 to 2017. 
This will help to identify the high risk spots and low risk spots, to be beter prepared medically. Other than that, people can be avare of the risk

the high risk nations and low risk nations to distribute the medical assitant acording to the risk.
